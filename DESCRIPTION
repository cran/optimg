Description: Provides general purpose tools for helping users to implement steepest
             gradient descent methods for function optimization; for details see
             Ruder (2016) <arXiv:1609.04747v2>. Currently, the Steepest 2-Groups
             Gradient Descent and the Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam) are the
             methods implemented. Other methods will be implemented in the future.
